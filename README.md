AWS is a cloud provider similar to Azure and GCP. Within AWS there are bunch of services. One of the service is sagemaker (2017) used widely in ML. To integrate external model to this, you can use Docker.

ECR (Elastic Container Registry) is again a service by AWS for uploading and storing docker images created locally.

Using Amazon SageMaker to train, test and deploy models is an efficient way of handling the machine learning lifecycle. Being an iterative process, using SageMaker allows data scientists to manage the entire machine learning pipeline with autoscaling provisions, advanced data security, data monitoring, model monitoring, high performance and low cost ML development. Compared to local or on demand set up, using SageMaker can save up to 67% of total resource utilization.
